# Nuxon
Nuxon is a library mod for Fabric 1.20.1 containing some useful API's for modding.  
This mod is primarily made for my own use in mod development, but it is free for anybody to use if they so wish.

Feel free to either add this as a dependency or embed it within your mod! I will document all the API's at a later date.  
Will hopefully be released on Modrinth with another one of my projects.
